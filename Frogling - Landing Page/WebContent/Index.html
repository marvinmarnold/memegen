			Frogling is a free android application that allows you to share your thoughts with your closest friends and
			even the whole world, using just a simple picture with several words. Basically, all you have to do is just find
			yourself in an interesting situation, enter the app and post a frogling (a picture with words) about it. After all,
			a picture speaks a thousand words, so imagine how much froglings can say!
